Hi, my name is ${alias} and I am a self-taught software developer with a strong interest in cryptography 
and BFT technology. I have always been fascinated by the power of computer programming to automate processes and bring 
about change. When I discovered Ethereum in 2018, I was immediately drawn to the concept of decentralized, autonomous 
programs that are resistant to censorship and capable of shaping the future. I have been following the Ethereum 
ecosystem closely ever since. Currently, I am working on a decentralized, trustless protocol for borrowing digital 
assets without the need for collateral or complex governance structures.
